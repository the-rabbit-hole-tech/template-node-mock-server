// The gateway's maintenance cycle, driven from the controls: announce a window, start
// maintenance, extend or update it, end it, or cancel an announcement. The window lives in the
// shared state, so every client sees the same one, and it goes back to none on a reset.
//
// While maintenance is on, the gateway paths (the GraphQL path, /auth, /setup, the product's own
// routes and new websockets) answer the product's maintenance refusal: by default 503 with a
// Retry-After until the window ends, the way a gateway in front of a stopped service answers.
// /readyz says not ready; /livez, /healthz and /_mock keep answering, and so do the root fields
// the product lists for its maintenance banner and the GraphQL operations its allow hook lets a
// caller run. A product whose gateway gates only GraphQL sets its scope to "graphql": then only
// GraphQL operations are refused, over HTTP and on the websocket, and everything else stays open.
